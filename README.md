# Battleship

First of all it a console app. You can download it and run.

The principle of work is very simple, you give the coordinates for 3 ships on (X (1-10), Y(A-J)) coordinates splitted by '-'. 

After they are set you can fire spots by giving it`s coordinates, for instance B7.

As soon as you destroy all targets, game is finished.
